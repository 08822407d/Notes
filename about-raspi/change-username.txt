How to change raspbian default uaername "pi" (if you are using Raspbian system)
At least it works for me(Raspbian 10 , 2020 April 5th), many people said that the recommanded way to change the default
username is to create a new user, the way below is not a perfect one. To do or not to do, it's your choice.
(As I'm not a native english speaker, this post may be contains many languagge errors, I am sorry for this)

1.You need to enable root, type following commands:
	sudo passwd root (to create root password);
	sudo passwd --unlock root (to unlock root);
	su root (to confirm you successfully enable root).

2.You close autologin (to prevent default user login when machine startup), do as following:
	Type command "sudo raspi-config" to change raspbian system setting;
	Goto "Boot Options";
	Goto "Desktop / CLI";
	Select "Console (requiring user to login)".

3.Enable root login through SSH
	sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config (to edit the file);
	Add line "PermitRootLogin yes" to the file, you are recommend to add it below a line contain a word
	"PermitRootLoginwithout" or something similar;
	Save and exit the file, then reboot system.

4.Login your device as root, and change username:
	Login as root, then type command "who", you may see ONLY ONE user "root";
	If there are other login users, as I have not face with this problem after doing above steps, it's so sorry that I
	can't give you some useful tips, please seek others help :(
	Else, type following commands:
	usermod -l your-user-name pi (modify the default user name);
	groupmod -n your-user-name pi (modify the group);
	mv /home/pi /home/your-user-name (move all files of the old username to the new one);
	usermod -d /home/your-user-name your-user-name (to change the Home dir of new username in the file /etc/passwd);
	Now you can reboot system, and login with your new user name, since the above do not contain anything about change
	user password, you may use the password of the default "Pi" username (and I assume that you have already set the
	password before you reading this post);
	After login, when the first time you type a command, your are required to enter your user password, just type once
	and the whole thing is done.Now you can enjoy the Pi with a username you preferred :)
